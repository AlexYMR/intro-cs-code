Use 'make all' in order to compile the entire project, which contains several files. It will compile the programs below, creating executables, which can be used as described below.

====================

keygen.cpp:
	Compilation: make keygen
	Usage: ./keygen <prime_Number_1> <prime_Number_2> <public_File> <private_File>
	Description: Given two prime numbers, keygen.cpp creates two files. The private file contains two numbers, generated by keygen.cpp, separated by a space. A private file is also created, sharing one of its two keys with the public file for decryption. The keys are generated using a relatively simplistic RSA encryption method.
	Known issues: Does not check the primality of prime numbers with over 6 digits because it's too time-consuming.
	
encrypt.cpp:
	Compilation: make encrypt
	Usage: ./encrypt <public_key_File> <input_File> <output_File>
	Description: Takes an input file and encrypts it using a form of RSA encryption, writing the result into an output file. Uses the public key file generated by keygen.cpp to accomplish this. Encrypted files will have large numbers that each represent a character in the original (clean) file, and they will be separated by newline characters.
	Known issues: Fails to catch mistakes in argument input (incorrect file name, missing file, etc.).
	
decrypt.cpp:
	Compilation: make decrypt
	Usage: ./decrypt <private_key_File> <input_File> <output_File>
	Description: Takes an encrypted input file and decrypts it using a form of RSA decryption, writing the result into a clean output file. Uses the private key file generated by keygen.cpp to accomplish this. Decrypted files will contain the original message encrypted using encrypt.cpp.
	Known issues: Fails to catch mistakes in argument input (incorrect file name, missing file, etc.). Runs slowly.

====================
// KNOWN ISSUES
--

- Takes a long time to execute when given large keys

- Cannot handle typo/missing file exceptions when file parameters are given
