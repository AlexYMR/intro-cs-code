Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is "the second act" of his epic undertaking,
and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. 
As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. 
Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The
Empire Strikes Back.That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high
the benchmark has been set.
